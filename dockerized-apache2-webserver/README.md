# Dockerized Apache2 Webserver

This project demonstrates how to run an Apache2 web server inside a Docker container. It is designed for beginners who want to learn how to containerize a simple web server using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started): Follow the instructions on the Docker website to install Docker on your operating system.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run your Dockerized Apache2 web server.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faruq2991/dockerized-apache2-webserver.git
cd dockerized-apache2-webserver
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Next, you'll need to build the Docker image from the provided `Dockerfile`. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
docker build -t apache2-webserver .
```

This command will create a Docker image named `apache2-webserver` based on the `Dockerfile` in your project.

### Step 3: Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run a container using the image. Use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 apache2-webserver
```

This command runs the container in detached mode (`-d`) and maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 in the container (`-p 8080:80`). Port 80 is the default port that Apache2 listens on.

### Step 4: Access the Webserver

After running the container, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the default Apache2 welcome page, which means your web server is running successfully inside a Docker container!

### Step 5: Stopping the Container

If you want to stop the container, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command lists all running containers and their IDs. Find the container ID for `apache2-webserver` and stop it with:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID of the container.

### Step 6: (Optional) Remove the Container and Image

If you're done with the container and want to clean up, you can remove the container and the image:

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
docker rmi apache2-webserver
```

## Summary

You have successfully created a Dockerized Apache2 web server! This simple project should give you a solid foundation for understanding how to containerize applications with Docker.
